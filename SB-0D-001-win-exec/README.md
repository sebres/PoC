## [SB-0D-001-win-exec] - PoC (Proof of Concept)

### &#x1F6A8; 0-day vulnerability "insufficient escape of special chars for quoting of arguments by exec process" by almost all languages for windows.

#### Prehistory:

Windows does not really provide a proper way to execute process with arguments (as list or array).<br/>
The major function that windows API (and many primitives in several languages) internally use is [CreateProcess](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ms682425), 
where parameter `lpCommandLine` is a complete command line (that should be proper combined, quoted and escaped from the caller),
which will be typically parsed hereafter inside child process (**after child process is started**).

There is not really ArgvToCommandLine or similar function.<br/>
The CRT-functions like [_spawn-family](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20y988d2.aspx) are not really useable,
because just doing simple join of arguments or argument-array without any escape/quoting, so they have a problem even by spaces inside argument:
> Spaces embedded in strings may cause unexpected behavior; for example, passing _spawn the string "hi there" will result in the new process getting two arguments, "hi" and "there". 
If the intent was to have the new process open a file named "hi there", the process would fail. You can avoid this by quoting the string: "\"hi there\"".

See for example 
[Everyone quotes command line arguments the wrong way â€“ Twisty Little Passages, All Alike](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/twistylittlepassagesallalike/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-command-line-arguments-the-wrong-way/) 
for several methods how people doing this.<br/>
BTW. The method provided there as solution is in my opinion also not completely proper: escape using circumflex (`^`) does not work in all quoting cases, 
and one should differentiate between invocation of exe- and batch-file.

Therefore the issue is rather a matter the weird windows unescape/unquote behavior in case of process execution and invocation of command processor,
so many languages seem to be affected similar way also by same vulnerability.

Thereby the vulnerability should be verified for two cases - execution of PE-executable (exe-files) as well as the batch-files (.cmd and .bat).

**Note:**
The major injury of batch-execution is happened by pre-processing of the arguments with special meta-chars (so depends on quotes-count or position), but some tests show that some languages seem to have here additionally insufficient escaping by some special characters (looks like vulnerable arguments-handling in any case, also by execution of the exe-files).

#### How to test:

Build `test-dump.exe` using MSVC or MINGW-gcc, which will be used together with [test-dump.cmd](test-dump.cmd) in tests for dump of arguments:
```bash
gcc -mconsole test-exec.c -o test-dump.exe
```
If no toolchain for build is available, simply download and unpack it from [test-dump.zip](https://github.com/sebres/PoC/files/2316009/test-dump.zip).

Hereafter just execute the test-script (see column "Test" in table above).
Each step of the test-case executes `test-dump.exe` as well as `test-dump.cmd` with some test arguments 
and compares the output of dump with original supplied arguments.

**Note:**
The tests will show if the arguments gets from `test-dump` are completely different (like most from the [results/jvm.diff](results/jvm.diff)) or vulnerable only on invocation of batch-files (see [results/tcl.diff](results/tcl.diff) or [results/python.diff](results/python.diff), where the execution of exe-file is not affected).

So in case of Perl (strawberryperl) or JVM-lang's (java, scala) because the execution of exe-files is affected by insufficient escape/quoting it is classified as **grave**.

The results are provided as diff-files for better readability of different/vulnerable places (red-marked) on github resp. most external diff-viewer.

Tcl-test script provides possibility to test other languages (so one don't need to write complex test-suite, it is enough to provide small simple caller-script like [test-dump-part.pl](test-dump-part.pl), used for example to test perl):
```bash
tclsh test-dump-inv.tcl -external perl test-dump-part.pl
```
In this case this tcl-test-suite will call perl, that will call `test-dump.exe` and `test-dump.cmd` with test-arguments.
Of course the fixed tcl-version should be used to check other language this way.
